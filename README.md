1. # Business Understanding
Churn prediction is a technique used to identify customers who are likely to stop using a product or service being offered by a company or organization. Churn prediction is important for businesses, especially those that rely on recurring revenue mostly through a subscription plan. Retaining already existing customers for the case of such companies is idealy more cost-effective in comparison to acquiring new customers.
By identifying customers who are at a high risk of churning, businesses can put proactive measures in place to prevent the churn and as a result retain the valuable customers.

2. # Problem Statement
To build a ML model that predicts which customers are likely to churn.

3. # Metric of success
Having a model that scores well on evaluation metrics like recall.

4. # Modelling
The model is built using the logistic regression algorithm, which is a popular and interpretable machine learning technique. It leverages historical data on customer churn, including information about customers, their purchases, demographics, and usage patterns, to make predictions about future churn.
