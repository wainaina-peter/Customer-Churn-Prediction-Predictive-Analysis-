# Customer-Churn-Prediction-using-Logistic-Regression
This repository contains a customer churn prediction model implemented using logistic regression. The goal of this project is to predict which customers are likely to churn, i.e., cancel their subscription or stop using the services provided by a telecom company.

The model is built using the logistic regression algorithm, which is a popular and interpretable machine learning technique. It leverages historical data on customer churn, including information about customers, their purchases, demographics, and usage patterns, to make predictions about future churn.
