1. # Business Understanding
Churn prediction is a technique used to identify customers who are likely to stop using a product or service being offered by a company or organization. Churn prediction is important for businesses, especially those that rely on recurring revenue mostly through a subscription plan. Retaining already existing customers for the case of such companies is idealy more cost-effective in comparison to acquiring new customers.
By identifying customers who are at a high risk of churning, businesses can put proactive measures in place to prevent the churn and as a result retain the valuable customers.

# Data Undestanding
The data is gotten from Kaggle and can be accessed using this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puja19/telcom-customer-churn?utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=kaggle-dataset-share&utm_source=twitter

The data contains 21 columns and the total observations are 7043.

2. # Problem Statement
The telecom industry is dealing with more customers leaving, and it's important to solve this problem for continuous growth and making money. The challenge is to find out why customers are leaving, create good plans to keep them, and take actions early to stop them from leaving. This problem statement is about understanding and fixing the reasons why customers are leaving the telecom industry.

3. # Main Objective
To reduce customer churn by implementing strategies to significantly reduce overall customer churn rates within the telecom company.

4. ## Specific Objectives
- To review the telecom data and identify what may lead to customer churn.
- To clean the data I.e check for missing values, outliers
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis in order to identify hidden patterns that may be in the data.
- Build a ML model that accurately predicts whether a customer is likely to churn based on the input variables.

5. # Metric of success
Having a model that scores well on evaluation metrics like recall.

6. # Modelling
The model is built using the logistic regression algorithm, which is a popular and interpretable machine learning technique. It leverages historical data on customer churn, including information about customers, their purchases, demographics, and usage patterns, to make predictions about future churn. 

7. # Recommendations
Based on the analysis conducted of the different columns against the target variable churn, I recommend the following:

- Introduce favorable bundle packages in order to retain and increase the subsribers with partners as they are less likely to churn based on the data.
- Have offers for people who pay yearly for subsriprion, for example offer them a discount as people who pay yearly or for two years are less likely to churn as seen in the data.
- Collaborate with phone services as people who use them are less likely to churn.
- Introduce packages that target people with no dependants as they are less likely to churn based on the data.
- Have a preference on paperless billing as it seems people who are billed in a paperless manner are more likely not to churn.
